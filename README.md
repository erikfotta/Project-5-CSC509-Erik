# Project 5 CSC509 Fotta

This repository is a compilation of problem solutions for basic array manipulation problems. The problems were source from [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=22), and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2). Files in this repository are organized by the source from which they came. 

## Part 1: Git Started

### CodingBat Problems

The problems from CodingBat are all located in a single xcode playground file, titled appropriately. This file contains six problems, each on their own page in the file. If this is not apparent immediately, look for the other pages by using the 'Project Navigator' tab in the left-hand menu. This menu is activated by using the appropriate button in the top right corner (similar to non-playground xcode files). The problems


### Project Euler Problems

The problems from Project Euler are each located in their own playground file. These are titled along the lines of 'Project 5 Problem X'

### Advent of Code Problems

The problem from Advent of Code is located in its own playground file. Titled appropriately.

## Part 2: GitHub

Check out this beautiful README.md!

## Part 3: In Partnership

I made changes to [Samar's Repository](https://github.com/sseth18/Project-5-CSC509). I made basic code formatting changes in his file [Arrays and Loops](https://github.com/sseth18/Project-5-CSC509/tree/master/Arrays%20and%20Loops.playground).
