# Project 5 CSC509 Fotta
Erik Fotta

This repository is a compilation of problem solutions for basic array manipulation problems. The problems were source from [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=22). Files in this repository are organized by the source from which they came. 


## CodingBat Problems

The problems from CodingBat are all located in a single xcode playground file, titled appropriately. This file contains six problems, each on their own page in the file. If this is not apparent immediately, look for the other pages by using the 'Project Navigator' tab in the left-hand menu. This menu is activated by using the appropriate button in the top right corner (similar to non-playground xcode files). The problems


## Project Euler Problems

The problems from Project Euler are each located in their own playground file. These are titled along the lines of 'Project 5 Problem X'
